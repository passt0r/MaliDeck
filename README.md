# MaliDeck
Glat to see you, member of Malifaux! Are you a powerfull Arcanist or you prefer some living dead girl, hm? It does not matter.
If you ever play in this game, you know how hard is it- taking all this cards with you at EVERY game. It's exhausting. 
But don't worry, my gambling friend. I have a good news for you.
This app help you with some most difficult tasks: you can take all of your card at home (exept playing deck, you may always take your frend's deck ) AND you can PLAY SOUNDS DURING GAME! 
Yes, when you kill somebody (in game, of course) or summon some zombies (because it's fun)
you can adding some sounds to take some new game experience! 
It's fun, you can try by yourself or we will get your money back! 
Oh, stop- a forget: this amazing app is FREE, so we did not refund you. 
Sorry.
BUT, you can help to make this app better. 
This app uses Realm, so we need to add some data to it. And implement some new features. 
But main load is on a board.
I hope you'll enjoy this program.
